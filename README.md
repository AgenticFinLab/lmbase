# Overview
`lmbase` is a unified platform designed to support experiments with various reasoning methods for large models (LLMs, VLMs) in reasoning. This codebase is designed to be _easy to use_ and ensures fair comparisons across methods. It provides different modules that facilitate the implementation of new reasoning algorithms and their experiments on diverse datasets across various tasks for comprehensive evaluation.
